# Music-Player-App-in-JavaScript

freeCodeCamp Practice Project 4. 

JavaScript Algrorithims and Data Structures.


I learnt some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.


In this project, I made a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. I even learn how to dynamically update the user interface based on the current song.
